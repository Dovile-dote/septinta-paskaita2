            <p>Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for his theory of relativity and
                specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received
                the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially
                for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.</p>

            <p><i>“The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly,
                    but one can think deeply and be quite insane.”</i></p>
            <p>Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described as the most important
                scientist and inventor of the modern age, a man who “shed light over the face of Earth”.
                He is best known for many revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and
